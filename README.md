An mysterious Adventure Game.
This Is my second C# project.
I kinda know the basic of C# and now I can make this cool stuff.
This Only took me like 20 minutes to complete the whole code.

How To Play:
- Open Visual Studio or any C# program that has a console app
- Copy the code and paste it to the project
- Save the code
- now you can play freely

WARNING: Don't change anything In the code!!!
